### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brittany Yarbrough and I'm a software developer currently enrolled at a coding bootcamp at General Assembly. I love the front-end aspect of development and making everything look as good as possible. 

About me:
I love movies (Halloween is my favorite)
I have three dogs who I love very much
