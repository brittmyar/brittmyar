### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a graduate of the Software Engineering program at General Assembly, I have a strong foundation in coding using various technologies such as Python, Django, React, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience in data analysis and visualization using tools like Tableau.

With a passion for data analytics, I started exploring online resources to expand my skills in this area. I have excellent communication and problem-solving abilities, which have helped me excel in data analysis projects. I enjoy working collaboratively in a fast-paced environment and am always eager to learn and grow.

With my strong work ethic and enthusiasm for new challenges in data analytics, I am confident in my ability to make a valuable contribution to any data analytics team
